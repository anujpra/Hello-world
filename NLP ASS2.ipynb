This can be either an opinion, a judgment, or a feeling about a particular topic or subject. The most common type of sentiment analysis is called ‘polarity detection’ and involves classifying a statement as ‘positive’, ‘negative’, or ‘neutral’. For example, let’s take this sentence: “I don’t find the app useful: it’s really slow and constantly crashing”. A sentiment analysis model would automatically tag this as Negative. A sub-field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis has been getting a lot of attention in recent years due to its many exciting business applications. By analyzing social media posts, product reviews, customer feedback, and NPS responses (among other unstructured data), businesses can understand how their customers feel about their product or service.  Sentiment analysis is particularly useful for social media monitoring because it goes beyond the number of likes or retweets, by providing qualitative insights. Imagine you just launched a new product feature and notice a sharp increase in mentions on Twitter. Are customers tweeting more because they are delighted with the new feature? Or, are they actually complaining about the feature? Performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data can help you quickly understand the tone of those mentions.\\n',\n",
